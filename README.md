Question 1 ) Logging  

logs = [
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:00] INFO user1: Started process",
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:01] ERROR user1: Failed to connect",
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:02] INFO user2: Login successful",
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:03] WARN user3: Low memory",
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:04] ERROR user2: Timeout occurred",
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:05] INFO user1: Retrying connection"
]



add_log(self, line: str) -> None
Parses the log and stores it in the system.


Also stores:


Logs per user_id (grouped),


Recent logs (up to capacity),


Frequency of each log_level (INFO, ERROR, etc.)


get_user_logs(self, user_id: str) -> List[Dict]
Returns a list of logs generated by the given user.


count_levels(self) -> Dict[str, int]
Returns a dictionary showing the frequency of each log_level.


filter_logs(self, keyword: str) -> List[Dict]
Returns all logs whose message contains the given keyword (case-insensitive).


get_recent_logs(self) -> List[Dict]
Returns the most recent capacity logs in the system.



# Log System in Python üêç

This is a simple Python-based log management system that helps you:

- Group logs by user ID
- Count log levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
- Keep track of the most recent logs (with capacity)
- Filter logs using keywords

## Features

‚úÖ Group logs by user  
‚úÖ View recent logs (with a limit)  
‚úÖ Search logs by keyword (case-insensitive)  
‚úÖ Count how many times each log level occurred  

## How to Use


logs = [
    "[2025-06-16T10:00:00] INFO user1: Started process",
    ...
]

log_manager = LogSystem(capacity=10)
for log in logs:
    log_manager.add_log(log)

print(log_manager.get_user_logs("user1"))
print(log_manager.count_levels())
print(log_manager.get_recent_logs())
